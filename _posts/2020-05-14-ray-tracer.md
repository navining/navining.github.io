## Introduction
This project is a simple ray-tracer written in C++.

## Features
- Spheres
- Diffuse material
- Metal material
- Dielectric material
- Emissive material
- Shadows
- Positionable camera 
  
## Build
```
make
```

## Run
```
./raytracing [samples per pixel]
```
This will render an image of 960Ã—540 with multiple samples per pixel (5000 by default).

The image is saved as "result.ppm" which uses PPM format. You can view the picture with
```
display result.ppm
```
or convert it into PNG format with
```
convert result.ppm result.png
```
## Result

![Result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/navining/raytracing/master/result.png)

This image is rendered with 5000 samples per pixel, which takes approximately 30 minutes on my laptop.
